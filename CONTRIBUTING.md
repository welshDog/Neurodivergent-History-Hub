## üîÑ Development Workflow

### ADHD-Friendly Workflow

We recognize that contributors may have ADHD or other conditions. Here's a flexible workflow:

1. **Pick ONE issue** to focus on (avoid overwhelm!)
2. **Comment on the issue** to let others know you're working on it
3. **Work in short bursts** (Pomodoro technique: 25 min work, 5 min break)
4. **Commit frequently** with clear messages
5. **Ask for help** anytime‚Äîno question is too small
6. **Take breaks** when needed‚Äîyour wellbeing comes first

### Making Changes

1. **Make your changes** in your feature branch
2. **Test thoroughly** - check in multiple browsers if possible
3. **Run accessibility checks** (see below)
4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: Brief description of your changes"
   ```

### Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

- `Add: Description` - for new features
- `Fix: Description` - for bug fixes
- `Update: Description` - for updates to existing features
- `Remove: Description` - for removing code/features
- `Docs: Description` - for documentation changes
- `Style: Description` - for formatting/style changes
- `Test: Description` - for adding or updating tests
- `Accessibility: Description` - for accessibility improvements

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ `Add: Keyboard navigation for timeline section`
- ‚úÖ `Fix: Screen reader not announcing profile cards`
- ‚úÖ `Accessibility: Improve color contrast in dark mode`

## üìù Coding Guidelines

### General Principles

- **Keep it simple** - Readable code is better than clever code
- **Comment your code** - Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- **Use semantic HTML** - Proper tags for proper meaning
- **Mobile-first** - Design for small screens, enhance for large
- **Progressive enhancement** - Core features work without JS

### HTML Guidelines

- Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- Include proper ARIA labels and roles
- Use heading hierarchy correctly (h1 ‚Üí h2 ‚Üí h3)
- All images must have descriptive `alt` text
- Forms must have associated `<label>` elements

**Example:**
```html
<button 
  class="profile-card"
  aria-label="View profile of Albert Einstein"
  role="button"
  tabindex="0">
  <h3>Albert Einstein</h3>
  <p>Physicist and Revolutionary Thinker</p>
</button>
```

### CSS Guidelines

- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for consistency
- Follow BEM naming convention when appropriate
- Ensure minimum 4.5:1 color contrast ratio (WCAG AA)
- Support user font size preferences (use `rem` not `px`)
- Test with browser zoom up to 200%

**Example:**
```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #4A90E2;
  --color-text: #333333;
  --spacing-base: 1rem;
  --font-size-base: 1rem;
}

.profile-card {
  padding: var(--spacing-base);
  font-size: var(--font-size-base);
  color: var(--color-text);
}
```

### JavaScript Guidelines

- Use vanilla JavaScript (no framework dependencies)
- Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`
- Write functions that do ONE thing well
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch
- Save user preferences to localStorage
- Provide clear console messages for debugging

**Example:**
```javascript
// Save user preferences
function savePreferences(preferences) {
  try {
    localStorage.setItem('userPrefs', JSON.stringify(preferences));
    console.log('‚úÖ Preferences saved successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('‚ùå Failed to save preferences:', error);
    showErrorMessage('Could not save your preferences');
  }
}
```

## ‚ôø Accessibility Requirements

**All contributions MUST meet these accessibility standards:**

### Mandatory Requirements

   - Visible focus indicators
   - Logical tab order

2. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Proper ARIA labels
   - Alt text for images
   - Semantic HTML structure

3. **Color & Contrast**
   - Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text
   - Don't rely on color alone to convey information
   - Test with color blindness simulators

4. **Text & Typography**
   - Text must be resizable up to 200%
   - Line height of at least 1.5
   - Support for user font preferences

5. **Forms & Inputs**
   - Clear labels for all inputs
   - Error messages that are clear and helpful
   - Success confirmations

### Testing Accessibility

**Manual Testing:**
- Navigate using only keyboard (Tab, Enter, Arrow keys)
